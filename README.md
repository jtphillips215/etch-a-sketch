This project is an etch-a-sketch styled like a gameboy and gameboy color. It is written using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a review before diving into React. This makes use of concepts like DOM manipulation and flexbox and runs entirely on the client side. It should be intuitive to use as dragging the mouse along the screen should result in a sketch being created.

It contains two "modes":
1. A classic black and white mode styled like a classig gameboy.
2. A color mode styled as a gameboy color that assigns randomly colored cells based on the original colors of the gameboy color.

The game runs as follows:
1. The player can drag their mouse along the screen to create a sketch.
2. The player can switch modes by clicking the "Classic" or "Color" modes.
3. The player can reset their doodle by clicking the "Reset" button.
